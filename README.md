# INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE FINAL EXAM 2021 - Soultions Dave Linder
This are my solutions to the final exam 2021 in introduction to data science. All the computations and the code as well as the data and plots and also this document can be found in the git-repository: `https://github.com/massstab/ESC403_exam.git`. I included also the .csv files asked for in the folder `report/data/`. The code is entirely written in Python. There is a `requirements.txt` file to install all the dependencies.
