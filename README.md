INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE FINAL EXAM 2021

This is a take-home, open-book exam, meaning that you are allowed to use the lecture notes and other
literature to answer the exam questions. Group work is not permitted; please solve the questions on
your own.
We are assigning you these questions on Monday, June 7 and you will have to hand your answers in
by Friday, June 11 at 23:59.
Coding problems can be solved using either Python or R.
Your answer will be graded not only based on the reported result but also on how you achieved your
result. Hence, please carefully describe the main steps of your solution in your own words and provide
us any scripts/code that you used in your solutions.
You can either upload your solutions in the dedicated ‘Final Exam Dropbox’ on OLAT (preferred) or
send them via email to Dr. Reed or the TAs.
